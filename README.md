# The Problem we're Solving
Managing money as a college student in India is tough. Students often grapple with:

‚Ä¢ Limited Allowances: Trying to make a fixed monthly allowance cover everything from fees and food to fun and emergencies.
‚Ä¢ The UPI Effect: Frequent, small digital transactions are hard to track, leading to a disconnect from actual spending.
‚Ä¢ Peer Pressure & Lifestyle Inflation: Social pressures can lead to impulse buys and spending beyond one's means.
‚Ä¢ Lack of Financial Guidance: Many students are navigating financial independence for the first time with little to no formal guidance.
‚Ä¢ Traditional expense trackers are often manual and fail to provide proactive, personalized advice that truly helps build better habits.
